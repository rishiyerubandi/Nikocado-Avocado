**story**
It was a cold, cloudy and foggy day. 
The warmth and the light from the sun hadn’t been showing for 3 days straight and it just stopped pouring rain. 
Nikocado Avocado had just finished filming a fast-food mukbang for his YouTube channel, hoping to go viral and get a few million views. 
He had short black hair and a ovular face. 
The sclera in his eye was bleached a bright red from crying and ranting about a new topic and he was wearing his signature red t-shirt which just barely wrapped around his plump body. 
His channel had been doing great, especially after he left Orlin, but Nikocado still wondered what Orlin was doing, even after the break-up. 
Although Nik didn’t want to think about him, he couldn’t get Orlin out of his head.
